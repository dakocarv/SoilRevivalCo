                                <li>Plants that struggle to grow or produce</li>

                                <li>Gardens that depend on chemical fertilizer to survive</li>
                                <li>Soil that looks and feels lifeless</li>

                            <p>If any of that sounds familiar, your soil is telling you something. Chemical fertilizers are a short term fix that can harm long term soil life. We take a different approach. We test what is really going on, treat the root cause, and help you build soil that feeds your garden naturally.</p>
